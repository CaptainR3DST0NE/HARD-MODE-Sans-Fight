This is a modified version of gotoAndDie's c2-sans-fight, which is a modified version of Jcw87's c2-sans-fight, except with harder attacks.
If you want to see any changes, please go to the gh-pages branch. I don't have Construct 2, so I'm not updating this branch. All I did was change the attacks, change some text... and clobber the "Infinite Loop Detected" function. So that's that.











# Bad Time Simulator (Sans Fight)
This project is a clone of the sans fight from [Undertale](http://undertale.com/).
It was made with [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2).

Known Issues
------------
- The blue heart jumping behavior is not exact. While most of the movements were made 1:1 from the original fight, this one was estimated.
- Heart hitbox is too small. Well, actually, it's more like a hit _point_.
- On the sans_platforms4 and sans_platforms4hard attacks, the platform is supposed to accelerate from 0 to its full speed, but I was lazy and started it at full speed immediately. This is only a problem if you try to dodge the bones without jumping.
- Screen shake is missing. While I could plop in any screen shake algorithm on the internet, I'm more interested in how Undertale did it.
- Sans dialog is missing. I may add something at some future date, but I have no intention of putting the original text in, as it really only makes sense in the context of the whole game.
- Missing documentation for custom attacks. I intend to add this at some point, but for now, you can reference the *.csv files in the repository. I may change how this works later, so don't be surprised if your custom attack breaks.
